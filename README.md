## Overview

This repository contains all coursework and practice from my **Object Oriented Programming and Design** course. It includes compiled notes (Mostly GFG), programming assignments, and some additional practice problems.

### How to Run

Each folder contains a main file along with supporting classes. To run a program:

1. Navigate to the appropriate folder. For example:
   ```bash
   cd assignments/assignment1
   ```
2. Compile all Java files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```
3. Run the main class:
