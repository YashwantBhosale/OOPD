### Identifiers in Java
ref: [**Java Identifiers**](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_variables_identifiers.asp)

An identifier is a name given to a variable, method, class, or package. It is used to identify and refer to a variable, method, class, or package in a program. 

Identifers can be short names (like `x` and `y`) or more descriptive names (like `age`, `sum`, `totalVolume`).

It is always recommended to use descriptive names for identifiers to make the code more readable and maintainable. The main advantage of it is that when someone else reads the code, they can easily understand what the code is doing.

### Rules for naming identifiers in Java

Just like every other programming language, Java has some rules for naming identifiers. 


Here are some of the rules for naming identifiers in Java:

**Note:** The rules marked as 
advisable won't give you compilation errors but it is advisable to follow them.

- Identifiers can contain **letters**, **digits**, **underscores**, and **dollar signs**.
- Identifiers must start with a **letter**, **underscore**, or **dollar sign**. Or in other words, the first character of an identifier cannot be a digit.
- Identifiers are **case-sensitive**.
- Identifiers should start with a **lowercase letter** and follow the **camelCase** naming convention. (advisable)
- Identiferes cannot contain whitespace characters.
- Identifiers cannot be a **reserved keyword**.
- Identifiers should be **meaningful** and **descriptive**. (advisable)
- Although, there is no limit on the length of an identifier, it is advisable to keep the length of an identifier to a **reasonable length**, maximum 10-15 characters. (advisable)


**NOTE:**
- The keywords `const` and `goto` are reserved in Java, even though they are not currently used.
- The keywords like `true`, `false`, `null`, etc. may look like identifiers but they are not. They are literals in Java. But they still cannot be used as identifiers.
