### Programming Paradigms

- **Programming Paradigms** are different ways in which a given program or programming language can be organized.
- Each paradigm consists of certain structures, features, and opinions about how common programming problems should be tackled.
- Programming paradigms are NOT languages or tools. You can't "build" anything with a paradigm. They're more like a set of ideals and guidelines that many people have agreed on, followed, and expanded upon.

#### Popular programming paradigms
1. **Imperative Programming**
- Consists of **sets of detailed instructions** that are given to the computer to execute in a given order. It's called "imperative" because as programmers we dictate exactly what the computer has to do, in a very specific way.
- Focuses on describing how a program operates, step by step.

2. **Procedural Programming**
- Procedural programming is a derivation of imperative programming, adding to it the feature of functions or "procedures."
- In procedural programming, the user is encouraged to subdivide the program execution into functions, as a way of improving modularity and organization.
- We can divide the whole process into smaller functions performing specific tasks in the bigger program.
- This simplification and abstraction is one of the benefits of procedural programming. However, within the functions, **we still write imperative code**.

3. **Functional Programming**
- Functional programming takes the concept of functions a little bit further.
- Functions are treated as **first-class citizens**, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
- Functional programming emphasizes immutability, meaning that data should not be changed after it is created.
- It encourages writing pure functions, where the output only depends on the input and there are no side effects.
- Common concepts in functional programming include higher-order functions, recursion, and avoiding shared state.

4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Object-oriented programming organizes code around **objects**, which are instances of **classes**.
- A class defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that its objects will have.
- OOP emphasizes the concepts of **encapsulation** (hiding internal state), **inheritance** (extending behavior from other classes), **polymorphism** (using a shared interface for different data types), and **abstraction** (hiding complex implementation details).
- Objects interact with one another to design applications and programs.

5. **Declarative Programming**
- In declarative programming, the programmer describes **what** the program should accomplish, rather than **how** to accomplish it.
- It abstracts away the control flow and focuses on the desired results.
- Examples of declarative programming include SQL for database queries and HTML for webpage structure.
- Functional programming and logic programming can be considered subsets of the declarative paradigm.

6. **Logic Programming**
- Logic programming is based on formal logic.
- Programs are written as a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain.
- A popular logic programming language is Prolog.
- The computation is the process of applying inference rules to derive conclusions from the known facts and rules.
